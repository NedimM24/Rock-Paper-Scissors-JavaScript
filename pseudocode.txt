COMPUTER CHOICE LOGIC
Write logic to get the computer choice
create a function named getComputerChoice() that randomly returns rock, paper, 
    or scissors using Math.randomly
Test the returned value w/ console.log(getComputerChoice())

HUMAN CHOICE LOGIC
Create a function called getHumanChoice
The function will use prompt to get user input
return the user input and test it in console.log

KEEPING SCORE
Create variables for computer and human and initialize to zero
if human wins +1 for humanScore
else if robo wins +1 for roboScore
else it's a tie

PLAY A SINGLE ROUND
Create a new function called playRound w the parameters HumanChoice and ComputerChoice
HumanChoice should be case sensitive so that rock, ROCK, ROcK and other variations are ok
Functionm to print to concole in this format, "You lose! Paper beats Rock".
Based on winner, humanScore ++ or computerScore ++ or tie

PLAY 5 ROUNDS
Create a function named playGame
Move the playRound function into playGame and run it 5 times w while a loop
    (Will need a helper variable to keep count of games)
if humanScore is greater than computerScore
    log to the console that human won
else if vise versa
    log to the console that the computer won
else its a tie
